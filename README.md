Project Title: Stock Performance Analysis of S&P 500 Companies using Pandas & NumPy

Project Goal: The goal of this project is to analyze the historical stock performance of selected S&P 500 companies using only Pandas and NumPy. I aim to identify key trends, risks, and opportunities in the stock market by applying essential data analysis techniques.

Vision:
To build a strong foundation in financial data analysis using Python and become a confident data analyst who can draw real-world business insights from raw data.

Mission:
•  To clean and process stock data of top-performing S&P 500 companies using Pandas and NumPy.
•  To explore trends such as stock returns, volatility, and moving averages.
•  To use only core data analysis skills (without advanced libraries) and still produce meaningful, professional-level results.
•  To prepare a project that is clean, well-documented, and insightful enough to impress my teacher and earn a job opportunity.

Step 1: Load and Explore the Data
•	Read CSV using pandas
•	Check columns: Date, Open, High, Low, Close, Volume, Name

 Step 2: Clean the Data
•	Handle missing values
•	Convert Date column to datetime
•	Sort by date
•	Filter out 3–5 top companies (Apple, Google, etc.)

 Step 3: Analyze Stock Trends
•	Calculate daily returns: Return = (Close - Open)/Open
•	Calculate moving averages (7-day, 30-day)
•	Compare performance between companies

Step 4: Use Numpy for:
•	Statistical measures (mean, std, max, min returns)
•	Correlation matrix between companies
•	Detect days with highest volatility
 Step 5: Visualize (Optional Bonus)
•	(Even though only pandas and numpy are required, we can generate .csv insights or basic matplotlib visuals if allowed.)

Step 6: Conclusion & Insights
•	Best performing stock
•	Risk vs return
•	Recommendation based on past performance
